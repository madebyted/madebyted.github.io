title: "New Year’s Resolution"

For many years now, I’ve been lurking around on the Internet. I’ve been in the business of web development professionally for more than half a decade now. During this time I’ve worked on everything ranging from small blogs, artist websites, auction sites and feature-rich communities. I’m a frenetic reader of blogs, newsletters and follows a lot of people on twitter. I enjoy keeping myself updated with the bleeding edge development of new tools and projects.

Many times have I considered to start blogging, sharing more code and knowledge with the community, and heighten my participation ratio on meet-ups. But never before have I made it my new year’s resolution to do so. During the year of 2011 I will slowly have myself participate more and contribute back to the community that has given me so much.

I have tried this in the past and failed. There are lots of reasons for this, but the main reason was that I had too high expectations on myself. I will not repeat that mistake.

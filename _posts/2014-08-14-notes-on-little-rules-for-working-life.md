title: Notes on “little rules for working life”

Last summer Sarah Allen realized she had a few “policies” to help navigate her day-to-day work activities and was kind enough to share them as “[little rules for working life][rules]”.

Almost a year later I run into said gem and decide to read it, but with a twist. I suggested to my significant other that we read it together – bullet by bullet – and discuss and reflect on each item in relation to ourselves and our experiences.

As it turns out, this was a great idea. Slowly going through each item and sharing our thoughts on the matter was both fun and insightful. I highly recommend doing the same with someone close to you.

Later on I tweeted about this which resulted in telling [Sarah I'd share my notes with her][tweet], so here they are.

## Two of my own policies

Before I share my notes on Sarah’s article I’ll share two of my own policies that help me in my daily commitments.

My memory is honestly quite horrible, so horrible in fact that as a knowledge worker, friend and colleague I can’t trust myself to remember the things I need to and therefore two things are essential for me to succeed in life and work:

1. Write down *everything*.
2. Make lists of *everything*.

Simple rules that makes all the difference.

**Write down everything** not only helps me remember, it forces me to *really* understand what I'm writing down and often puts things in new light.

**Make lists of everything** removes a lot of stress by letting me know that I won't miss that small, yet important, detail in the process of doing something.

## Notes on “little rules for working life”

What follows is quotes in part or whole from Sarah's article (which I recommend you read first) and my own thoughts on the subject. Feel free to ask me to elaborate in the comments.

> I never take a job where I don’t know at least one team member very well.

It turns out I can back this 100%.

My first job in the software development industry was a crazy startup (aren't they all) which taught me a lot of things, but more importantly I made a lot of friends and contacts.

After three years at that startup it was time to do something else so I took a job at a random consultancy company at which I knew no one from before. I choose not to continue there after the trial period and went freelance. After that experience I've only taken jobs where I know at least one other team member really well.

In hindsight this make a lot sense. I value trust and teamwork a lot – two things that takes a lot of time to build and I'd rather not start over completely when I join a new work place.

> Do a quick web search before you meet with or hire someone.

I agree that some checkup is important but I also try to keep in mind not to get my view of someone corrupted before I meet them just because I misapprehend some of the information I might run into.

> Think through the desired outcome, before hitting send.

Pause … pause often and review if you should continue with what you're doing. Ask yourself, on a post-it, “why am I doing this” and “is this the best way of doing it”?

> Iterate. Celebrate. Iterate. Celebrate. I wish I knew where I read this. Celebrate the little things. You can’t really control the big win. It’s the small series of little wins that we can make happen. We need to celebrate these.

I agree and I need to get better at this myself. To often we wait for the big win and simply find ourselves in an anticlimax. Make more of the little wins.

> For parties, always buy a good lager, not Michelob or Bud, and something non-alcoholic too.

Don't go cheap and don't forget the non-alcoholic. Sarah says it better than me “Know your team and cater to their whims, when you can, but keep the Jack Daniels off the list for the holiday party”.

> Tell someone’s boss, in writing, when they do a great job.

Promote a feedback culture with friends and colleagues at all times. [Give (and receive) both constructive feedback and praise][feedback].

> Never say that solving a software problem will be fast, say it is “straightforward.”

Excellent advice that I'll bring with me from now on.
